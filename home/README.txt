Welcome to the playground!

You're inside a x86_64 virtual machine running inside of webassembly.
The virtual machine runs debian bookworm, with some stuff added.

The following of my projects are installed there:
- Where esolang (/usr/local/bin/whereso)
- Advanced esolang (very indev, terrible performance in vm) (/usr/local/bin/adv)

There are also a few utilities added:
- vim
- neofetch
- curl
- less

Note: Even though the VM has network access, the CORS policy blocks all domains other than ketok.xyz. Furthermore, http (not https) won't work on browsers that disallow mixed content.
